Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The project I was solving was how to make a simple clock program for a microwave. This allows us to set and change the clock time. 

What did you do particularly well?
I did pretty good on this assignment. My professor gave me a 100% on this specific project.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I can enhance my code by making it less complicated. If the code was cleaner and more straight forward, it would take up less physical memory and have less chance of frailer.  

Did you find writing any piece of this code challenging, and how did you overcome this? What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
I found the initial instructions a little challenging do to me not knowing where to start. I overcame this by making a flowchart. This allowed me to organize my code and give me a step by step directions on what to do in order to complete this program.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
The skills I have acquired from this project include critical thinking, new perspective and C++. These skills will transfer with me help me in all my future projects. These skills can be used in all forms my future career. 

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I made this program maintainable by first making a flowchart for the assignment, this allowed me to visualize everything to ensure it all works. I made the project readable by including general information in the code that explain what the code does as you read through it. I made it adaptable because of the information that describes the code within the code. This allows you to change it where you want to.
